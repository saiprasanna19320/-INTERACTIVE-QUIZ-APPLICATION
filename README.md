 Description for my project is :
 
     The Interactive Quiz is a dynamic web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring multiple-choice questions (MCQs), a 15-second countdown timer with sound alerts, and real-time answer feedback, where correct answers turn green and incorrect ones turn red; it also includes a dark mode toggle for better user experience, a final score display, and a fade-in animation for smooth transitions, making it an engaging and educational tool; future enhancements could include API-based question fetching, user profiles, multiple quiz categories, and a leaderboard system, transforming it into a more advanced and personalized learning platform.
